        <!--TODO: This works - it is responsible, but there is a problem with the scrolling aspect of the page:
        
        Use case: to have extra content which could be scrolled to, below the grid 
        (possibly explaining the algorithm visualised on the page etc.)
        => for that, the main element has overflow set to auto
        However, when on overflow happens,
        IT DOESN'T HAPPEN DOWNVARDS, But upwards, pushing the grid up
        for this reason, the grid is partially pushed UPWARDS, CAUSING THE TOP ROW OF THE GRID TO BE OVERLAYED WITH THE HEADER

        => POTVRZENI JE, ZE WHEN THERE IS NO OVERFLOW, THEY FRONT ROW IS FULLY VISIBLE AND NOT PUSHED UP
            => I.E WHEN <div class="extra-content"> is commented out, the issue never arises
            => but when it is visible (not commented out, the issue always arises when there is overflow 
            (when the page runs in a maximized window on a PC monitor))
        
        -->
        <!-- <div class="extra-content">
            <p>Here is some extra content below the grid!</p>
            <p>You can add more sections, images, or any other elements as needed.</p>
